# Project Information

This project aims to provide user-friendly interface for searching movies and TV series. It offers links to where users can watch the movie and gathers information, such as description, year, and quality of the movie from provided links. Currently, it scrapes data from two websites offering free movie streaming and from Rotten Tomatoes. Additionally, it provides information on where the movie is available for streaming on platforms like Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, and Vudu.
